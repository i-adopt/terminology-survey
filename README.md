# Survey of existing observation-centric terminologies
This repository is used for addressing issues related to task 2 of the I-ADOPT workplan.

Task 2: Survey observation-centric terminologies
Conduct a survey, and synthesize the results of related surveys conducted by other groups (like
the Polar Vocabulary survey39), of observation-centric top-level representations (in most cases
ontologies) and domain-specific terminologies (mostly taxonomies, thesauri, controlled lists for
units, methods, instruments, etc.) in use. If necessary, prepare a questionnaire to be sent out Q1
2020, (6 weeks of circulation). This will contribute to building a fine-grained collection list of semantic representations of
observable properties (as input for task 4) and to a catalog of domain specific terminologies.

The survey was designed between October 2019 and January 2020
It was launched on 23 January 2020. It targets both terminology users and terminology providers and has been designed in such a way that responders can be either or both.

Preliminary results were presented at the [I-ADOPT session at RDA 15 Virtual Plenary](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/vocabulary-services-ig-interoperable-descriptions-observable-property-terminology-wg-i-adopt-0) and can be browsed in slides 17-27 of this [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u5iKwnTJdSpExJdrLR-xE2Cv3x3mGY-yM6kNc1xEav4/edit#slide=id.g81a7dc456f_0_1).

A list of terminologies gathered in this survey as well as an initial analysis is available [here](./results).
