This repository is used for addressing issues related to task 2 of the I-ADOPT workplan.
Task 2: Survey observation-centric terminologies
Conduct a survey, and synthesize the results of related surveys conducted by other groups (like
the Polar Vocabulary survey39), of observation-centric top-level representations (in most cases
ontologies) and domain-specific terminologies (mostly taxonomies, thesauri, controlled lists for
units, methods, instruments, etc.) in use. If necessary, prepare a questionnaire to be sent out Q1
2020, (6 weeks of circulation).
This will contribute to building a fine-grained collection list of semantic representations of
observable properties (as input for task 4) and to a catalog of domain specific terminologies.
