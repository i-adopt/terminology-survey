This repository is used for addressing issues related to task 2 of the I-ADOPT workplan.

Task 2: Survey observation-centric terminologies

Conduct a survey, and synthesize the results of related surveys conducted by other groups (like
the Polar Vocabulary survey39), of observation-centric top-level representations (in most cases
ontologies) and domain-specific terminologies (mostly taxonomies, thesauri, controlled lists for
units, methods, instruments, etc.) in use. If necessary, prepare a questionnaire to be sent out Q1
2020, (6 weeks of circulation).
This will contribute to building a fine-grained collection list of semantic representations of
observable properties (as input for task 4) and to a catalog of domain specific terminologies.

Please check the questionnaire here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1M8utiNZkzTDMVzPnqGJhlER45U1-s2e5UvVSAp0GGgg/edit (this is just a copy of the original)

There was the request to provide two different types of questionnaires, one for terminology providers and one for terminology consumers. 
See here:
for providers: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bUKcMviJr9UGUS6haVo_IcR0TRVxdNAISsPouE55Fpo/edit
for consumers: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1X5xE492Tir5yPi0BrmF2aA4bOcozYafzE_0olrL7K64/edit
